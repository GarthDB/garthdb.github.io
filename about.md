I'm a designer–engineer who spends most of my time thinking about how decisions get made — and how we make them easier to share, reuse, and trust over time.

For the past fifteen-plus years, my work has lived at the intersection of design systems, front-end engineering, and open collaboration. I've helped build and scale design systems inside large organizations, taught designers and engineers how to work better together, and contributed to the web and open-source communities that shaped my own career. Across all of that work, one question keeps pulling me back: how do we codify design decisions in a way that serves both humans and machines, without losing the intent, judgment, and values behind those decisions?

I don't see design and engineering as separate disciplines that need to be "aligned." I see them as different ways of looking at the same system. Much of my role has been about translation — turning design intent into durable, inspectable structures, and turning implementation constraints into meaningful feedback for designers. That translation shows up in many forms, from design tokens and component APIs to governance models, documentation, and the quieter work of helping teams articulate why something exists, not just how it works.

Clarity, accessibility, and long-term maintainability matter to me, not only in the products we ship but in the systems and relationships that make those products possible. I care about building things that age well — technically, culturally, and organizationally.

A large part of what I know comes from the generosity of others: people who shared their thinking in blog posts, open-source projects, conference talks, and late-night forum replies. I've always felt a responsibility to give back to that ecosystem. Over the years, that's meant writing, teaching, mentoring, speaking, and creating space for thoughtful discussion rather than performative certainty. I'm especially drawn to work that helps teams move from asking "what should we build?" to asking "how do we decide, together, and at scale?"

Today, my focus is increasingly on design systems as infrastructure. Beyond components, I'm interested in the data, governance, and decision-making frameworks that sit underneath them — the parts that often determine whether a system empowers people or quietly constrains them. Lately, that curiosity has expanded into questions about structured design data, how systems can be understood by both people and tools, and how emerging technologies like AI intersect with design systems without replacing human judgment.

If you're thinking about how design decisions get made, shared, or sustained over time, there's a good chance we'll have something to talk about.
