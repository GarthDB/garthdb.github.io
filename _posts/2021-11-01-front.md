# Front Utah 21

This was my second talk at Front and my first time speaking again after the primary pandemic shut down. It was nice to be back in person with other designers and managers, but it didn't feel like everything was back to 100% normal (whatever that means). I was the closing speaker this time, which isn't really my favorite time slot, and I just didn't have the same energy as usual, but I enjoyed the chance to speak again.

## My Talk

### How to establish and maintain a design system

As teams and products grow it can become complicated to maintain consistency across all properties, additionally, there is often a duplication of initial work for each product starting from scratch. By establishing and maintaining a company-wide design language and design system implementation, teams are better equipped to ensure consistency, reduce duplication of work, and improve overall design and code quality.
