# The Design Systems Podcast

I joined the Knapsack team for a podcast conversation on design tokens, governance, and what it's taken to scale Spectrum design data at Adobe.

We talked about treating design decisions as structured data, where governance actually belongs, and the kinds of constraints that only show up once a system reaches real organizational scale.

The discussion draws directly from my work on Spectrum design tokens, release processes, and long-term stewardship of design data.
