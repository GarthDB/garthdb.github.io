## Session Description

Design is a key part of any project. When used correctly it can communicate the product goals, it can entice new contributors, and it can make the product itself more effective.Garth Braithwaite has been the visual and experience design lead on a few projects including Brackets. He will discuss how to successfully solicit design contributions, and how to manage them.

Although the design community is becoming more active in the open source community, there are still times when developers are required to play the role of designer on a project. Garth will also spend time discussing design fundamentals and things anyone can do to improve the basic design of projects.
